# Block16: Advanced Array Methods in JavaScript

---

## Guided Practice: Array Methods

### Overview
Engage in the nitty-gritty of various array methods, enhanced by the window `prompt()` method for real-time user interaction.

### Learning Objectives
- Familiarize with essential array methods: `map`, `filter`, `forEach`, `reduce`, and more.
- Integrate user inputs and use them within array methods.
- Efficiently represent and manipulate lists through arrays.

### Steps to Follow:
1. **Setup**: Initiate by creating two essential files: `array_methods.html` and `array_methods.js`.
2. **Structure HTML**: Within the HTML file, ensure to include the tags: `html`, `head`, `title`, and `body`. Remember to link the JS file using the `script` tag.
3. **Predefined Data**: Move to the JS file, where a predefined `items` array awaits your operations.
4. **Search an Item**: Employ the `prompt()` method to solicit the name of the desired grocery item. Store this input in a variable, say `name`.
5. **Find Method**: Implement the `find` method on your items array, matching the item name against the stored `name` variable. Store the resulting value in a variable, perhaps `found`.
6. **Conditional Logging**: Depending on whether the item was found, log respective messages to the console.
7. **Further User Interaction**: Again, prompt the user, this time to input a string. This will be used to identify if any item corresponds with this string in its name.
8. **Filtering**: Apply the `filter()` method to isolate items from the array which resonate with the search string.
9. **Mapping**: Proceed to use the `map()` method, asking the user to select a key and then display associated values.
10. **Reduction**: Finally, dive into the `reduce()` method to sum up values for a chosen key.

### Peer Review & Reflection
- Utilize the Canvas rubric to review peer progress from Block 15.
- Reflect on the collective progress concerning established learning goals.
- Discuss and share individual accomplishments and challenges.

2. **Examination**: Browse through the `README.md` file to understand the proceedings.

### Criteria for Evaluation
1. **Code Style**: Emphasis on meaningful and consistent variable names.
2. **Functionality**: Ensuring accurate outputs for given functional inputs.
3. **Array Methods Mastery**: Demonstrating proficiency in using methods like `forEach`, `find`, `filter`, `reduce`, `map`, and `slice`.
4. **Return Keyword**: Properly leveraging the `return` keyword with methods like `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`.
5. **Callback Syntax**: Correctly passing callback syntax to various array methods.

### Submission
After aligning with the criteria and completing the workshop, submit the link to your GitHub repository.
